    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nearly every child born in the 1970s and 1980s is familiar with this horrific fusion. This disgusting snack was likely
        created by a mother who hated her child. The only thing worse than making your son or daughter this abomination is to 
        pack it in their school lunch so they have to eat it in front of their peers.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
